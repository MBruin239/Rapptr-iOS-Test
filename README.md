Issues:

I did not know the format the web API wanted the email and password to come in so I never got that to actually return success. But the functions are setup for when there would be one.

I was struggling with the navigation bar going translucent so I set the window background color to the header background color as a work around.

Notes:

I used Gifu as my CocoaPod https://github.com/kaishin/gifu becuase I wanted somthing extra to go with the fade out/in functionality.


Thank you!
